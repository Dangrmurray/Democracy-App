# Vote.ly

## A civic engagement application that informs the general public on current legislative acts and encourages citizens to be part of the political discourse.

### About our App

We created a full stack  application called Vote.ly that lets voters be more engaged citizens in the Political process. Our application calls on  the Pro Republica API to look up congressional representatives and the bills they are sponsoring also accounting for how far bills are along the legislative process. 
The user is authenticated through Google Oauth and assigned a unique id. Each user ID is pertinent to dislaying particualr demographic statistics of vote results. Upon vsiting the website (Heroku Deployment info) each user will login through Google OAUTH and unique user information along with congressional bills will be stored in a Mongo database.
